<b><i>Abstract:</b></i> Observations of Europa’s leading hemisphere reveal elevated H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in the warmer, low-latitude chaos terrains compared to the colder, polar regions. This distribution disagrees with prior laboratory radiolysis studies of pure water ice, which show higher H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> yields at colder temperatures. The regions with higher peroxide abundance, Tara and Powys Regiones, also present increased amounts of CO<sub>2</sub>, possibly sourced from Europa’s interior. To investigate whether CO<sub>2</sub> influences radiolysis of water ice to boost H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production, we irradiated water ice doped with varying amounts of CO<sub>2</sub> with 10 keV electrons at 70 and 100 K. Our results indicate that CO<sub>2</sub>, even in trace amounts (<3%), significantly enhances H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> yields at temperatures relevant to Europa. We discuss the mechanisms by which CO<sub>2</sub> boosts peroxide synthesis and quantify H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> creation and destruction cross sections and G-values across different CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations. These findings provide a plausible explanation for the perplexing H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> distribution on Europa and has implications for understanding peroxide on other icy bodies such as Ganymede and Charon, where it has been detected alongside CO<sub>2</sub>.
