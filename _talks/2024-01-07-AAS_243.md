The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will allow for continuous wavelength coverage of transit spectra from the mid-optical to mid-infrared for the first time. Such broad wavelength coverage necessitates a reassessment of how aerosols are modeled. In this talk, we discuss how aerosol species of various size and shape distributions will appear in JWST transit spectra, specifically focusing on deviations from spherical particles. We modeled nonspherical particles using the distribution of hollow spheres (DHS), a computationally efficient model that approximates the distribution of small, randomly oriented nonspherical particles. Incorporating DHS theory allows for a comprehensive model of clouds and hazes, altering features present in the classical Mie scattering model. By integrating DHS into existing transit spectra code, we can create a model that will allow for measurements of various clouds and hazes in exoplanet atmospheres. If nonspherical particles are affecting transit spectra to a significant degree above noise, it will become necessary for other studies to consider the effects in future transit surveys.
