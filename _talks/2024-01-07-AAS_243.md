This was a presentation on the research I completed in my undergraduate with Dr. Caroline Morley and post-doc Brianna Lacy. 
Project Goal: Investigating whether deviations from spherical haze particles will be detectable in JWST transit spectra.
My tasks:
Creating a module to incorporate into an existing transit spectrum code which implements the distribution of hollow spheres approach.
Modeling transit spectra with a variety of shape distributions, particle compositions, and other atmospheric properties to explore whether deviations from solid homogeneous particles will be detectable.
