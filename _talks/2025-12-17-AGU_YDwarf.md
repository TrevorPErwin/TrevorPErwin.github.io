Understanding cloud formation in planetary atmospheres requires accurate treatment of microphysical processes, particularly the interactions between aerosols and volatile gases. However, many current models, such as the Community Aerosol and Radiation Model for Atmospheres (CARMA), do not account for these interactions, potentially misrepresenting cloud structure, particle growth, and radiative properties. As such, we investigate the role of hygroscopic salts, such as potassium chloride (KCl), in shaping cloud properties in Y-dwarf and exoplanetary atmospheres. 

In this talk I will discuss present laboratory experiments aimed at quantifying the interaction of KCl particles with water vapor under simulated Y-dwarf conditions. Using a Spherical Void Electrodynamic Levitator (SVEL), I suspend individual KCl particles and expose them to controlled amounts of water vapor across a previously unexplored temperature regime (300–450 K), representative of Y-dwarf atmospheric conditions. This setup allows for the direct observation and measurement of deliquescence and particle growth in real time, providing critical constraints to the rate of water uptake and onset of heterogeneous nucleation. Complementary experiments using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) used to investigate latent heat release and freezing-point depressions for KCl–H$_2$O mixtures may also be presented. 

These experimental results enable us to map the thermodynamic pathways of cloud evolution and will be used to inform future updates to CARMA while more broadly highlighting the importance of incorporating salt–vapor interactions into planetary atmospheric models. By grounding our understanding in laboratory data, we aim to improve predictions of cloud formation and radiative behavior in Y-dwarfs and other salt-rich planetary atmospheres.
