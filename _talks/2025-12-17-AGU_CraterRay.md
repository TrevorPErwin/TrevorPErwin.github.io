Impact-generated crater rays are well-documented on the Moon, with most appearing as high-albedo streaks extending radially from a crater’s center. On Mars, however, crater rays are significantly rarer and discernible only through thermal imaging due to their lower thermal inertia compared to surrounding terrain. This study presents the first comparative analysis between the lengths of Martian and lunar crater rays, including lunar albedo rays and cold spots, which are ray-like thermal anomalies associated with many of the youngest lunar craters. Our findings indicate that both Martian crater rays and lunar cold spots extend significantly farther than lunar albedo rays, with lengths an order of magnitude greater for craters of equivalent diameter. Furthermore, we propose a connection between the formation mechanisms of Martian crater rays and lunar cold spots based on their thermal properties. By integrating thermal rays into existing ejecta models, we refine the understanding of crater-ray formation and suggest that Martian crater rays and lunar cold spots may share a similar formation mechanism via secondary cratering processes. Advancing knowledge of these features has implications for impact dynamics and surface evolution across planetary bodies.
